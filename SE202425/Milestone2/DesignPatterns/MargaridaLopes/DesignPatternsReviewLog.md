## Reviewed by Gon√ßalo Farias
The explanation of the Facade pattern is well-presented and easy to follow.
The code snippet clearly demonstrates how the CommandWrapper class encapsulates command registration details
The rationale highlights how the class simplifies the process for users by abstracting complex command setup details.
Nothing to point out!

# Facade pattern
## Reviews by Mariana
The identification of SpongePlayer as a Facade is well-supported. 
This reduces dependencies and shields other classes from potential ServerPlayer changes, 
which is excellent for maintainability. The Design pattern seems accurate.
