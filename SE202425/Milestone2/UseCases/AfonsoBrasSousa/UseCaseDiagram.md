| **Brief description:** Player saves a complex build as a schematic file that is saved locally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Preconditions:** WorldEdit must be installed by the player. The build is completed and already selected by the player using the appropriate tool. The player must have enough free space in their hard drive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Main flow:**<br>1. Player types a command to copy the selected build (`//copy -eb`) into the clipboard.<br>2. Permission manager checks if Player has necessary permissions (worldedit.clipboard.copy)<br>3. The build is copied and passed to the clipboard manager.<br>4. The Player types a command to save the clipboard content into a schematic file (`/schematic save [filename]`).<br>5. Permission manager checks if Player has necessary permissions (worldedit.clipboard.save, world.schematic.save)<br>6. The schematic file is saved with the provided filename and a success notification is shown. |
| **Alternative flow:**<br>3., 6.: If the Player hasn't got the necessary permissions an error notification is shown and nothing happens.<br>6.: If the Player hasn't got enough disk space an error notification is shown and nothing happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Postconditions:** Schematic file is saved in local storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Main flow:**<br>1. Player types a command to copy the selected build (`//copy -eb`) into the clipboard.<br>2. Permission manager checks if Player has necessary permissions (worldedit.clipboard.copy)<br>3. The build is copied and passed to the clipboard manager.<br>4. The Player types a command to share the clipboard content as a schematic online (`/schematic share [name] [destination] [format]`).<br>5. Permission manager checks if Player has necessary permissions (worldedit.clipboard.share, world.schematic.share)<br>6. The schematic is uploaded to the server and a shareable URL is pasted to the clipboard of the Player. A success notification is shown. |
| **Alternative flow:**<br>3a, 6a. If the Player hasn't got the necessary permissions an error notification is shown and nothing happens.<br>6b. If the user has no network connection an error notification is shown and nothing happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Preconditions:** WorldEdit must be installed. Player must be in a valid location to execute the commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Main flow:**<br>1. Player types a terrain manipulation command (`//fill`, `//drain`, `//fixwater`, etc.) and specifies the radius and other parameters for the manipulation<br>2. Permission manager checks if Player has necessary permission for the specific command (worldedit.fill, worldedit.drain, ...)<br>3. Player specifies the radius and other parameters for the command<br>4. Terrain manager validates the operation area<br>5. The terrain is modified according to the command parameters<br>6. A success message shows number of blocks affected |
| **Alternative flow:**<br>2a. If Player hasn't got the necessary permissions, an error notification is shown and nothing happens.<br>4a. If area is protected/invalid, an error notification is shown and nothing happens.<br>5a. If operation fails due to world constraints, an error notification is shown and nothing happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Postconditions:** Selected area of terrain is modified according to the command parameters. World state is updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
